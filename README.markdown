## GKSessionP2P
A Universal (iPhone/iPad) Xcode storyboard project that illustrates the ad-hoc networking features of GKSession. The app both advertises itself on the local network and automatically connects to available peers, establishing a peer-to-peer network.

Please note: Bluetooth networking is not supported in Simulator.

You'll need to run at least two instances of the app to set up a P2P network. Build the application using Xcode and run it on a device or the simulator. Wait for another application instance to join the network. Devices / simulators must be on the same network or within Bluetooth range to see each other. Connected peers will appear in the peer list.

## Build requirements
Xcode 4.5, iOS 5.0 SDK, LLVM Compiler 4.1, Automated Reference Counting (ARC).

## Runtime requirements
iOS 5.0 and later
